# k-sim
kafka simulator 

A simple simulator trying to work through bottleneck/constraints theory as applied to a few simple Kafka topologies.

## Requirements
(See `client` for local development details. Basically, it's a create-react-app project.)

## Basic Usage
Go into the "client" directory and run:  `npm install` then `npm start`

After that, experiment with the `setttings` and `layout` available in the `App.js` file.  (Hopefully those become interactive in the site, for now you need to reload to restart.  Or edit the settings in App.js, which triggers a rebuild and reload.)
